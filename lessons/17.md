## Twitter & &amp;amp;

![Bug report 1](https://cdn.glitch.global/903cc5c9-7314-4e26-a9d3-8953c224cd66/a2cecdca-8b1d-48c6-9eb5-520c006d003a.image.png?v=1654759104688)

### Fix in “views/partials/tweets.hbs”

Change `{{tweet.text}}` to

```handlebars
{{{tweet.text}}}
```

???

This bug is coming from “views/partials/tweets.hbs” the code that shows the tweet text is `{{tweet.text}}`.

This will send the text to the browser so it shows exactly as the code is sent to it (including escaping the & so it shows on the screen) . 

`{{{tweet.text}}}` will just send the code, and the browser will show it properly.

I mentioned the first time we used handlebars that if something looks shonky try chnaging the number of brackets (2 or 3), this is exactly why.

---

### Further Point

There are other issues with the twitter text. Twitter takes addresses like t.co/eyfgqeiuhf and makes them links.

You could try to find a library on npm.com that takes the twitter api json and turns it into html (I have seen one) and use that in a handlebars helper (which are added in "config/hbsConfig.js").

---

## Documents

Adding a new type of url route for "Document Collections" failed. Instead it looks like adding this functionallity to the page makes more sense.

---

### Add the template code to "views/page.hbs"

Add the following at the end of the <article>.

```handlebars
 <!-- Documents -->
 <ul>
    {{#each page.data.documents as |doc|}}
      <li>
        {{log "doc" doc}}
        <a href="{{doc.document.url}}" target="_blank">
          {{doc.document.name}}
        </a>
      </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
  
  ```

???

#### What will it do?

What layout will this template put the documents in?
Is that what you want?

---

### Test It

In your glitch editor open the "LOGS" and "Clear" them before going to your "/health-and-safety" page

- Does that do what you expect? 
- Does it look good?
- Look in the logs, is there extra info you could use to make it better?

---

### Next Steps
- Use the document_title and document_description info to make the template better
- Would it make sense to use the related pages idea to add this document collection to the bottom of the booking and activities pages?
  - How would you do that?

---

## Add related pages info to /:pages etc.

### At the end of "config/prismicConfig.js"

```javascript
export const getPage = async function (page) {
  return await client.getByUID("page", page, {
    graphQuery: `{
      page {
        ...pageFields
        related_pages {
          page{
            ...on page{
              ...pageFields
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }`,
  });
}
```

---
  
### Import getPage() into "server.js" 
  
Near the top of "server.js" change `import { client } from "./config/prismicConfig.js";`  
to 
  
```javascript
import { client, getPage } from "./config/prismicConfig.js"; 
```

---

### Use getPage() in "server.js" and maybe routes files
  
Where you have `const page = await client.getByUID("page", req.params.page)`  
you can change it to 

```javascript
const page = await getPage(req.params.page)
```

???

Be super careful with this change. Your line might go `const page = await client.getByUID("page", req.params.page).catch(` etc.  
Make sure you leave the `.catch(` alone
  
  
---
  
### Create new partial "views/partials/related_pages.hbs"

```handlebars
<aside class="related_pages">
  {{#each page.data.related_pages as | subpage | }}
  {{!log "subpage" subpage}}
    <figure>
      <a href="{{subpage.page.url}}"> 
      <img src="{{ subpage.page.data.main_image.url }}" alt="{{subpage.page.data.main_image.alt}}" >
      </a>
      <figcaption>
        <a href="{{subpage.page.url}}"> 
      <em>{{asText subpage.page.data.title }}</em>. 
        {{ subpage.page.data.content.0.text }} ... {{! first line/paragragh of text }}
        {{! asText subpage.page.data.content }}
        </a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  {{/each}}
</aside>
```
  
---

### Add the partial wherever you want

At the bottom of the any template you want the related pages to appear, but above `{{#extend "scripts"}}` if it is in this template.

```handlebars
{{> related_pages}}
```
