# Better file watching and validating your html

## Making the server auto restart better

Make it notice when you change tweet.hbs and all the other fiddly bits.

???

There is a default watch list. 

A list of files that when you change them it triggers reinstalling or restarting.

Which file(s) trigger reinstalling?

### Add a new file "watch.json"

```json
{
  "install": {
    "include": [
      "^package\\.json$"
    ]
  },
  "restart": {
    "exclude": [
      "^draft",
      "^dist/"
    ],
    "include": [
      "^\\.env",
      "\\.json$",
      "\\.js$",
      "\\.md$",
      "\\.hbs$",
      "\\.css$"
    ]
  },
  "throttle": 100
}
```
